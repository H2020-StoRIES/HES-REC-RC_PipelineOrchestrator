# Configuration-driven dispatcher for Reference Case

This repository enables the configuration-driven execution of the reference case simulation and optimization models. 


## Getting Started
To set up your repository correctly, make sure you have the dispatcher and other Reference Case modules under the same top-level folder.

Choose to configure you ``study.yaml`` file according to the required screening. Then run the Dispatcher like this:
````bash
$ python PipelineDispatcher.py Study_simple.yaml
````

... and see it failing

## This is a work in progress ...
